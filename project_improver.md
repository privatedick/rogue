# Project Improver - Automated Code Enhancement System

## Overview and Purpose

The Project Improver is a system designed to enhance project code during off-hours by leveraging available API calls to the Gemini API. The system focuses on making meaningful improvements while having access to the entire project context, rather than working with isolated files.

### Key Design Philosophy:
1. Utilize the 21,600 available daily API calls (15/minute)
2. Work with full project context for better understanding
3. Maintain and improve code quality through automated testing
4. Keep documentation up-to-date automatically

## Module Structure

### 1. Core Module (`core.py`)
The main orchestration module that coordinates the improvement process. It handles:
- Project-wide improvements
- API call management
- Improvement coordination
- Task scheduling

### 2. Analyzer Module (`analyzer.py`)
Responsible for understanding the project context:
- Analyzes project structure
- Identifies improvement opportunities
- Understands code dependencies
- Provides context for other modules

### 3. Cache Module (`cache.py`)
Manages caching to prevent redundant API calls:
- Memory and disk-based caching
- TTL support
- Thread-safe operations
- Efficient resource usage

### 4. Documentation Module (`documentation.py`)
Handles documentation generation and updates:
- API documentation
- Project architecture docs
- README maintenance
- Context-aware documentation

### 5. Testing Module (`testing.py`)
Manages test creation and validation:
- Generates unit tests
- Creates test fixtures
- Validates test quality
- Integrates with existing tests

## Operation

The system runs during off-hours (e.g., nightly) and:
1. Analyzes the entire project
2. Identifies improvement opportunities
3. Makes improvements with high confidence
4. Updates documentation
5. Generates and runs tests
6. Maintains a working backup

## API Usage Strategy

Rather than being overly cautious with API calls, the system:
- Makes use of available API quota
- Focuses on meaningful improvements
- Uses project context for better results
- Caches results to avoid redundancy

## Implementation Details

### The System:
1. Creates a working copy of the project
2. Provides full context to the AI
3. Makes improvements with high confidence
4. Validates changes through tests
5. Updates documentation
6. Applies verified changes

### Safety Measures:
1. Working on copies, not original code
2. Test validation before changes
3. Full context awareness
4. Confidence thresholds
5. Proper error handling

## Usage Recommendations

1. Initial Setup:
   - Configure ignored files/directories
   - Set confidence thresholds
   - Define operating hours
   - Set up backup strategy

2. Monitoring:
   - Review improvement logs
   - Check test results
   - Verify documentation updates
   - Monitor API usage

3. Maintenance:
   - Review and adjust thresholds
   - Update ignore patterns
   - Verify backup strategy
   - Monitor system health

## Future Development

Potential areas for enhancement:
1. More sophisticated improvement strategies
2. Better context understanding
3. Enhanced test generation
4. Smarter API utilization

## Notes

The system is designed to maximize the value of available API calls while maintaining code quality and safety. It prioritizes making improvements with high confidence while having access to the full project context.
