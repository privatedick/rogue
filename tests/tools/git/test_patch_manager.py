"""Tests for the Git-based patch management system.

This module provides comprehensive testing for the patch management system,
including parallel patch operations, complex Git workflows, and error handling.
It verifies both basic functionality and advanced features like concurrent
patch application and resource management.

The test suite uses pytest fixtures and async testing to ensure thorough
coverage of both synchronous and asynchronous operations.
